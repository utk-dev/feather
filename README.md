# _Feather_
Feather is a small CSS file that makes your HTML pages less horrible by applying some clean styles.

Yes, it's that simple.

It has a DARK MODE version for people who want that!

[Light Mode File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utk-dev/feather/master/feather.css "Feather-Light")
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utk-dev/feather/master/feather.css">```

[Dark Mode File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utk-dev/feather/master/feather-dark.css "Feather-Dark")
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utk-dev/feather/master/feather-dark.css">```

Recommended Usage: Don't write your own styles on top of feather. It'd take more effort compared to a clean slate. In case feather doesn't look right to you, don't use it.
